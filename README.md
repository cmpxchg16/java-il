# java-il

Welcome to Java.IL - the Israeli Java Community and user group. Whether you are a Java developer (or any other JVM language), JVM internals enthusiast, keeping on top of the Java ecosystem or interested in influencing the future of Java, you have come the right place.

Java.IL is a consolidation of the three leading Java groups in Israel: JJTV, הבוציה and IL JUG, with the aim of creating a unified, vibrant community.
